#Objective
With the information provided the purpose is to create several different tables that allow us to compare the information, in this case we are going to be taking a look into how the averages of the math and reading scores, the percentage of student that pass one or both subjects, can be related to the amount of students of their school, the budget their school has, the time of school, their grade, the size of the school or whether or not is a Charter or a District school

#Conclusions
With the tables provided we can see some particular trends, a list of the most remarkable:
Charter schools have a slightly better average score in both Math and Reading
Charter schools have a remarkable higher percentage of Passing Math, Reading, and overall passing, being higher by 27%, 16% and 37% repectively
The size of the school also correlates with a better average, being Medium and small schools being significatly better than large schools
Anti-intuitively the les budget per student an school has, the better the averages and the % of students passing is better, this is probably due that District schools have more students, and receive more budget per student, and we have already noticed District schools perform significantly worse than Charter schools
We can notice that the top performing schools, and the bottom performing schools are Charter and District schools respectively, which confirms that District schools perform worse
